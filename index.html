        <h1>Welcome to Me as an AI chatbot</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by. I built this AI chatbot while completing some Agentic AI training, partly as a way to explore what’s now possible with modern AI—and partly to offer a simple, interactive way for prospective employers and clients to get to know me.
        This bot can answer questions about my background, experience, and the kind of work I do, as well as demonstrate how I approach problem-solving, communication, and technology. Think of it as a smarter, more engaging version of a CV: active, conversational, and available whenever you are.
        Feel free to ask anything, try things out, and explore. I hope this gives you a useful glimpse into my skills and how I think about bringing AI into real-world operations and solutions.
        If you’d like to talk further, I’m always happy to connect.</p>
